## Credits

+ These are the fundamental dependencies of Nostalgist.js:
  + [RetroArch](https://www.retroarch.com/) and its associated emulators/cores
  + [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/)

+ We are using ROMs here for the purpose of demonstration:
  + [retrobrews](https://retrobrews.github.io/) and the authors of the homebrew games

+ By default, our ROMs and cores are all loaded from this free CDN service:
  + [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/)

  However, it may be less suitable for modern frontend development workflows.
